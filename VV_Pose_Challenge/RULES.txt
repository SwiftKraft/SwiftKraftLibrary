---- Viewmodel Vault Pose Challenge ----

For this challenge we'd like you to hit the provided poses throughout your anim! 
Can you fit them into your animation naturally? Or will it be whacky? You decide!

Rules:

- You must use the Grease Gun we've given you (credit: https://sketchfab.com/TastyTony)
  It can be customized, textured, decorated etc. however you want, but it must still
  be similar enough to the base model. It has bones, but you are free to rig to taste.

- You must hit all 4 poses IN ORDER throughout your animation. It can be a reload, inspect,
  full sequence, whatever! The first pose is given as an idle, but the rest are open to 
  interpretation. Timing doesn't matter, as long as each pose is hit in succession.
    
- Feel free to use whatever arm rig and scene setup you want. We're not giving you the
  exact poses, but the goal is to get as close to them as possible. We should be able to
  flip through everyone's pose and have it relatively cohesive :)

- Submissions are due in October (exact date to be determined based on how people go!)

- Have fun!!
